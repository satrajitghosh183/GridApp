Localisation Problem Solution using Unity and ML


Overview


This repository provides a solution for the localisation problem using Unity and machine learning (ML) techniques. The goal of localisation is to determine the position and orientation of an object or agent in a given environment. In this project, we leverage the capabilities of Unity, a popular game development engine, and ML algorithms to solve the localisation problem.

Prerequisites


To use this solution, you need the following:

Unity: Make sure you have Unity installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Unity from the official Unity website (https://unity.com/).

Machine Learning Libraries: This solution utilizes ML algorithms. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed. Commonly used libraries include TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Unity's ML-Agents package.

Installation



Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/localisation-problem.git
Open Unity and navigate to the project folder you just cloned.

Set up the ML environment by installing the necessary libraries and dependencies. Follow the instructions provided by the specific ML library you are using.

Usage
Launch Unity and open the project.

Explore the project files and familiarize yourself with the structure and assets.

Configure the localisation problem settings, such as the environment, objects, and agents, according to your requirements.

Implement or import the ML algorithms to train and predict the position and orientation of the objects or agents in the environment. You can use the ML-Agents package provided by Unity or your preferred ML library.

Train the ML models using the available data or generate new training data if required.

Test the trained models in the environment to evaluate their performance and accuracy.

Iterate on the ML algorithms, training data, and environment settings as necessary to improve the localisation results.

Once you are satisfied with the results, you can integrate the localisation solution into your own project or application.
